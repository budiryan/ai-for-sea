# AI For SEA: Ride Safety Track
My solution for Grab's AI for SEA challenge: Ride Safety Track

## Requirements
1. Python 3 (version >= 3.6 recommended)
2. `pip`
3. `virtualenv`

## Setup
1. Install Python 3 on your system
2. Install `pip`
3. Install `virtualenv`: `pip install virtualenv`
4. Generate virtual environment directory: `virtualenv env`
5. Activate virtual environment:
    * Mac / Linux: `source env/bin/activate`
    * Windows: `env\Scripts\activate.bat`
6. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Predicting Your Hold-Out Test Set
1. Place the folder containing the test CSV files inside the root project directory. 
   Please make sure the folder is STERILE and contains the test CSV files only.
2. `python predict_test.py --source [PATH_TO_TEST_FOLDER] --destination [PATH_TO_PREDICTION_CSV_FILE, e.g.: predictions.csv]`

## Project Presentation
### Feature Engineering
Due to hierarchical nature of the train data, features are generated by aggregating the data points for each of `bookingID`.
The generated features mainly contain basic statistical aggregation combined with some non-trivial feature engineering

Here are the list of the aggregated features:

|           Feature          |                                                            Description                                                           |
|:--------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| basic statistical feautres | mean, min, max, std, 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile of  all train dataset columns  except: `bookingID` and `second` |
| trip_duration              | total trip duration                                                                                                              |
| n_stops                    | calculates number of stops during a trip                                                                                         |
| hit_mean, hit_max, hit_std | the mean / max / std of speed differences when the vehicle stops                                                                 |
| naive_distance             | calculates the naive distance of at trip by simply summing all the `speed` column                                                |
| stopping_time_ratio        | gets the stopping ratio during the last 5% of the trip                                                                           |
| num_acceleration_change_x  | number of acceleration changes in x-axis                                                                                         |
| num_acceleration_change_y  | number of acceleration changes in y-axis                                                                                         |
| num_acceleration_change_z  | number of acceleration changes in z-axis                                                                                         |


### Modelling
For modelling, model stacking approach is utilized. A High level diagram explaining the approach:

![alt text](docs/modelling.png "Model Stacking Diagram") <!-- .element height="100px" width="150px" -->
For the first layer, models such as: RandomForest, ExtraTrees, LightGBM and XGBoost are used to generate meta-features for the second layer training.
Each model is trained on a 5-Fold Stratified Cross Validation.
Finally, Ridge Regression is used to train the meta-features and generate the final predictions.
